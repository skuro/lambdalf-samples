AlfrescoBox -- a DropBox like feature for Alfresco, powered by Clojure!

As part of the [lambdalf-samples](https://github.com/skuro/lambdalf-samples) series, AlfrescoBox demonstrates how you can write your clojure code to:

- write your own webscripts (thanks to the spring-webscripts-addon-clojure)
- bind a clojure behaviour to onAddAspect events
- manipulate content such as add new aspects or setting new properties
